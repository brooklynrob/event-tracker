<p class="lead">About Happening Here</p>
    
<p>When approaching the CS50 Final Project, my primary interest was to further my knowledge of the following related topics:
Seeding databases with live data from existing data, primarily in JSON formats that needs to be iterated over and read
Creating my a backend that both served up some basic views but also had an API of its own to which frontends could be written that called data from the backend via the backends own API.</P>

<p>It was creating this backend that was my focus first and foremost in this project.</p>

<p>To illustrate and “bring to life” the backend, I created two front ends, one primarily in JavaScript and partially based on the PSET8 map javascript, and the second an iOS app in Swift using a tutorial by as a starting point.</p>

<p>Extending and building these two front ends allowed me fulfill a 3rd topic I was interested in -- building similar interfaces 1) iOS via a Swift and 2) Javascript and JQuery. While the two interfaces are not identical I was happy with the relative similarity I was able to accomplish.</P>
